Access Modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords which control the access of fields or methods or the class itself.
    There are four access levels and three access modifier keywords. These are only applicable to
    instance or static variable not to local variables.
private:
    Private is the most restricted one. if we use private keyword with any variable or method.
    we can only access it within the same class.
When we should use private access modifier.
    We should always try to create variables as private.
    The data that we store inside the private variables is secured.
default access modifier:
    Default is not a keyword. whenever we don't assign any access modifier keyword like private or
    public Java assigns default access level to those variables or methods.
    The variables or methods which have default access level can be accessed wihin the same class or in any other
    class that is present inside the same package.
Public access modifier:
    Public access most unrestricted access modifier. Once used with an variable or method we can access that variable
    or method anywhere in our project.
Note:

We can have only one public class in a file and the name of that class should match
the name of the file.
